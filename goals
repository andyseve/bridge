2. Keeping Track of all the history
3. Ncurses frontend to display all the values.

5. Profile based scanning to indicate patterns in bidding (I think I need the whole hands for this, so its going to be hard)
6. Maybe keeping track of all the tricks (Not really feasible while playing unless I want to generate data).
